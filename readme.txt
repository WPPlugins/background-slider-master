Creates easy to use fully responsive background sliders that can be applied globally, or to individual pages and posts.

== Description ==
Background Slider Master is designed with a very simple interface so anyone can easily upload images and attach a fast loading responsive background slider to any page or post.

You can choose to create a single slider that displays globally on every page, or create as many background sliders as you want, and attach them to each page individually to show something different.

This plugin can easily show a large gallery with the convenient thumbnail navigation. There is also an option in the top right corner to show the original image ratio for galleries. Or choose to disable the thumbnail navigation for beautiful looking background images behind your content.
